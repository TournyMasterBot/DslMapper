# Overview
This tool is designed as a mapping tool for [Dark and Shattered Lands](http://www.dsl-mud.org/). 

# Important Note
Most of this project is AI generated.

# Other stuff
There is a good chance this software can be utilized for other grid-based map projects such as dungeons and dragons, but it was not created for that purpose, and changes to this software will not be to that end. If you would like to make those changes, great! Fork the repository and have a blast.
